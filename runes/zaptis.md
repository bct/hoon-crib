#### Syntax

One argument, fixed.

  !=  p

- Wide

  !=(p)
  ```

- Irregular
- None.
{% /table %}

#### AST

```hoon
[%zpts p=hoon]
```

#### Produces

The Nock generated by `p`.

#### Discussion

Don't confuse `!=` with a negation, `!`, followed by a test for equality, `=(10 11)`.

#### Examples

```
> !=(20)
[1 20]

> !=(~zod)
[1 0]

> !=((add 2 2))
[8 [9 3.110.356 0 31] 9 2 [0 4] [7 [0 3] 1 2 2] 0 11]
```

Don't confuse the `!=` rune with:

```
> !=(10 11)
%.y

> !=(10 10)
%.n
```

The syntax difference is that a test for equality takes two subexpressions, and
the `!=` rune only one.
